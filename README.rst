KACPAW (formally known as KACSAW)
=================================

readme stuff goes here


Running Tests
-------------
1. Set the environment variables ``KA_USERNAME`` and ``KA_PASSWORD`` to your KA login info.  If you want all the tests to pass and are someone other than me, you should set ``KACPAW_TEST_PROGRAM_ID`` to a program id for a program you own.  Otherwise, you will get some not-authorized error because you can't edit my program
2. Run ``py.test -v`` in this directory.
3. Be patient!  The tests might take some time because we need to send some requests to KA.

here I will put things like the github page, links to tools I use, a link to the PyPI page if I make one, etc
